# Finding Lane Lines 

##Pipeline description

For this project I used opencv library for finding lane lines on the road.

My pipeline contains following steps:

1- Color selection: for color selection I used HLS color space. I did this because performance of RGB image for
challenge video was not good. But by this transformation I got good performance. After transformation I
selected white and yellow colors in image using cv2.inRange() command and tuned high and low threshold for
this selection.

2- Gray scale: then I converted result of previous step to gray scale image.

3- Dilate: I used cv2.dilate() function to increases the white region in the image.

4- Gaussian blur: then I used cv2.GaussianBlur(), a Gaussian noise kernel to smooth the image.

5- Canny edge detection: then used cv2.canny() to detect edges in the image.

6- Region of interest: after that I selected a region in image which the probability of lane lines in that is more than
other regions.

7- Hough transformation: then I used hough transformation to find lines in the RoI. In this part I tuned parameters
of hough transformation to have good performance.

8- Then I merged original image and image with drawn lane lines together. 

By applying above pipeline on images, results are as follow:



In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by separated lines
based on their slope to left and right lines. Then I calculated slope, intercept and length of each line and
assigned more weights to lines with more length. I also used a 0.5 threshold for slopes to remove lines with
fewer slopes and have a smoother performance and prevent drastic changes in drawn lines. After that I used
mean of parameters of left and right lines and used line equation to calculate x based on y, slope and intercept: 

y = slope * x + intercept

Finally, I draw each line using cv2.line() command.

After working on images, I applied my pipeline on test videos and challenge video.


## Shortcoming

 Highly sensitive to color

 Highly sensitive to tuned parameters

 Sensitive to existence of objects such as cars, pedestrians, animals and so on in region of interest

 Requires hard coded regions

 Highly dependent on lane location

## Possible improvements to my pipeline

 Automatic calculation of corners of RoI.

 Tuning parameters of pipeline such as hough transform parameters, edge detection, color selection, RoI and so
on to improve performance and have more robust pipeline.

 Use previous frames to prevent drastic changes in slope of drawn lines.

 Use some methods to draw curves not only lines on lane lines.
